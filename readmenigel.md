Part 2: The technical stuff

2.1 The tools used for this project

This project was built using PHP as the server side, HTML and CSS as the front-end of the website, and XAMPP Apache Server as the localhost server. Bootstrap was used
as the framework to build the front-end of the website. MySQL is used as the database. The website is taken from a source code found from this website: https://download.code-projects.org/details/2759a6ff-3a12-4b75-b979-4d31a269ee15

2.2 How to use the website

If you wish to register as the Booking Agent, Mountain Guide, and Sales Agent, you must upload a photo of a certificate but the folder's directory is to be from a specific
folder which can be found in this zip you have downloaded. 

To get the pictures, navigate through this branch here which is: htdocs\1181101303_1937_Amended FYP Code\nigel\image_upload.

Note: htdocs can be found in your xampp folder that you created.

To login as the Admin, here are the credentials:

To access the database, please upload the file "kinabalu5.sql" into PHPMyAdmin. That way, the database will be connected to the website.
